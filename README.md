## Pi Camera System --- Created by Prabhas Kumar

# Story

Everyone need the Security - Camera! But I wanted to do something innoavative! So I created My Own Pi Camera System w/ RPi & to innovative Path ---> I put Room to ML. Right now it is simple Open-CV Computer Vision! But in future maybe Deep Learning or something.

# Hardware

1. Your Sexy Rpi Board - I planed to use Rpi. Zero W but due to lack of micro-USB to USB Cabel, actually I got Broken Cabel, & in lockdown due to Covid-19 I can't find any decent                          priced Cabel in stock!

2. Any Camera, I used CSI 5 MP Camera

3. 3-D Model/ Case/ Wooden Box for both Rpi & Camera

4. Power Source  --- I used Official 15.3 Watt Adapter

5. Hanger or Outside 3mm Double Sided Tape

6. Safety Instruments like ESD Mat, ESD Wrist-Band (For Operationg Open Camera Like Mine), Eye Protecting Glass etc.

7. HDMI Cabel & Monitor(If you don't choose Headless mode)  --->  I used VNC-Viewer as my choice

8. Mouse & Keyboard (either integrated or Saperate)

9. Buzzer or LED(with 220Î© resister circuit) ---> For Indicator of Situation


# Set-UP

Connect your Camera and set-up if needed(get help from internet)

Power on Rpi. 

Open the link in source of any of my program in this repo which says to install OpenCV on Rpi. 4.
And Follow it accordingly.

Change any Variables in ./PCS/PCS.py as your need! Use comment as guide.

I recommend to run with smaller intervals to check the system then finally change!

Put it in your case or model. I used Official Rpi-4 Case, Rpi Zero Case for camera Z& my 3-D model to adjust the Camera(See Proof Section)! FYI, I included my 3-D models on ./PCS/3-D

Hang it with Hanger or Outside 3mm Tape
